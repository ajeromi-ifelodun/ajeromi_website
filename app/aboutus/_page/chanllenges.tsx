          Ajeromi-Ifelodun covers about 2,216 hectares of land, with 97%
          developed and 3% consisting of gutters, canals, and swamps. The local
          government lies geographically below sea level, with half of the land
          being reclaimed swamps. Its dense population includes diverse ethnic
          groups and cultures, creating a semi-urban community driven by a
          retail economy.
